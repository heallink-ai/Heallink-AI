# Heallink AI Engine Enhancements

## Overview

The Heallink AI Engine has been enhanced with several features to improve reliability, performance, security, and observability while maintaining full compatibility with the existing LiveKit agent functionality.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Request Tracking & Timing

- **Unique Request IDs**: Each request gets a UUID for tracing through logs and responses
- **Processing Time Metrics**: Response headers include processing time for performance monitoring
- **Client IP Tracking**: Client IP addresses are tracked for rate limiting and security purposes

### 2. Rate Limiting

- **IP-based Rate Limiting**: Limits requests to 100 per minute per IP address
- **Configurable Limits**: Easily adjust rate limit parameters in the code
- **Informative Responses**: 429 responses include Retry-After headers

### 3. Enhanced Logging

- **Detailed Log Format**: Includes timestamp, log level, process ID, and thread ID
- **Thread & Process Tracking**: Better debugging of concurrent operations
- **Log Rotation**: Built-in support for log rotation to manage log file sizes

### 4. Error Handling

- **Standardized Error Responses**: Consistent JSON format for all errors
- **HTTP Exception Handler**: Custom handler for HTTP exceptions
- **Global Exception Handler**: Catches and logs unexpected errors

### 5. CORS Support

- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**: Configured to allow appropriate cross-origin requests
- **Security Headers**: Proper headers for secure communication

### 6. Health Checks

- **Basic Health Endpoint**: Simple endpoint for checking service status
- **Version Information**: Includes application version in health responses
- **Timestamp**: Includes current server time for checking service availability

## Modular Architecture

The enhancements have been implemented in a modular structure:

- **api/health.py**: Health check endpoints
- **core/logging.py**: Enhanced logging configuration

## Next Steps

The following enhancements could be added in the future:

1. **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus metrics for monitoring request rates, errors, etc.
2. **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures when external services are unavailable
3. **Request Validation**: Enhanced input validation with better error messages
4. **API Key Authentication**: Add API key support for service-to-service communication
5. **Rate Limit Storage**: Move rate limit data to Redis for distributed deployments
6. **Feature Flags**: Configuration-based feature toggles

## Compatibility

All enhancements have been implemented to maintain full compatibility with the existing LiveKit agent functionality. No changes to the client applications are required.
